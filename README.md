Complete EDA,FE,DATA CLEANING PROJECT

Project Explanation:
In this project, I worked on the Google Playstore dataset to perform complete Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The workflow included:

Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

Cleaning and transforming columns like "Installs", "Size", "Price", and "Reviews" for better usability.

Creating new meaningful features to enhance insights (like app size categories, price bins, etc.).

Analyzing patterns related to app categories, ratings, installs, and user feedback.

Preparing the cleaned and feature-engineered dataset for potential machine learning models or further analytics.

The main objective was to transform the raw Playstore data into a structured, insightful format and uncover interesting trends and anomalies within the app market.
